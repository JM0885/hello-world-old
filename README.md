# hello-world

Hi, this is Jared. I am a software engineer wannabe, an advanced concert violinist, and a father and husband. I live in Nova Scotia but want to live in at least ten different countries before I die and I want to play the Mendelssohn violin concerto with the New York Philharmonic before I die as well.
