# hello-world

Hi, this is Jared. I am a front end developer, and quickly learning more to become a back end developer as well. I'm an advanced concert violinist, and a father and husband. I live in Nova Scotia but want to live in at least ten different countries before I die, code an app the gains a million users, play the Mendelssohn violin concerto with the New York Philharmonic, learn ten languages, and save a million dollars.
